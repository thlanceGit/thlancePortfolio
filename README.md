# thlancePortfolio

This is a homework project to build a website portfolio about myself and showcase past and future projects.

I've attempted to make this responsive to different screen viewing sizes, but will be updated as my skills improve.

Mostly I have tried to practice flexbox and grid layout methods to help alignment and sizing.
